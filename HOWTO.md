FLESnet usage for FLIB stand alone readout
==========================================

Note the **FAQ** section at the end of the document!

For information regarding the legacy CBMnet readout please also refer
to [HOWTO_LEGACY.md](HOWTO_LEGACY.md).


FLESnet
-------

    cd build
    ./flesnet --help

Modify `flesnet.cfg`:

  - Choose `processor-executable`, e.g., to store data.

#### Usage:
Start `flib_cfg` to configure FLIB before starting *flesnet*.
Flesnet will automatically read all activated FLIB links.

    ./shm_flesnet

NOTE: In case *flesnet* crashed, exited with an exception, was stopped,
or is just not working, you might need to clean up some things.
See the FAQs for the cleanup procedure.

FLIB Config
------------

    cd build
    ./flib_cfg --help

Modify `flib.cfg`:

  - Set the data source for each FLIB link.
    For reading from a FLIM use 'flim'.
    Note: link 0 is the link closest to the PCIe connector.
  - Set links you do not intend to use to 'disable'.

#### Usage:
    ./flib_cfg

Do not start/stop while flesnet is running!

Enable readout
--------------

After the FLIB is configured and shm_flesnet is started you need to
enable the readout via
       ./en_readout


Preparing the FLIB
==================

Download a bit file from the build server
----------------------------------------

run, e.g.:

    curl -O -u <GSI web login user> https://cbm-firmware.gsi.de/result/XXXX/flib_flesin/XXX/htg_k7_flesin.bit

(NOTE: Failing to provide a valid user/password won't give an error
but result in an unusable file.)

Programming the FPGA
--------------------

Copy `contrib/flib-jtag` to a location in your path and adopt settings.

You can:

  - Add the command to call impact
  - Fix the Xilinx Cable serial number
  - Choose if you like to use a CSE server
  - Choose if you like to run the script remotely

Note: Do not source Xilinx `settings.sh` in the environment/shell you
like to run/build flesnet! This will replace your glibc and cause
problems. You might add the full path to impact to flib-jtag instead.

#### Usage:
    flib-jtag prog path/to/bitfile.bit

If programming the FPGA the first time since powerup or
your machine does not support PCIe hot-plugging, you need to reboot
the machine after programming.

Check if FLIB is operational
----------------------------

The script `contrib/flib-check` should give you something like:

Check if:

  - 'LnkSta:' shows 'Speed 5GT/s' and 'Width x8'. Otherwise the card is not
    running with full capabilities. Try to replug the card or switch to another
	PCIe slot.
  - After you used the FLIB/flesnet the first time, 'Kernel driver in use'
    shows 'uio\_pci\_dma'.


FAQ
===

### What should I do if Flesnet exits with:

    ERROR: rdma_bind_addr(port=20079) failed: Cannot assign requested address
	terminate called without an active exception

  - Check if there are leftover processes for a previous run.
  - Check if *localhost* is set properly in `/etc/hosts` or
    try to use *127.0.0.1* instead of *localhost* in  `flesnet.cfg`.


### What should I do if something went wrong?

If *flesnet* crashed, exited with an exception, was stopped,
or is just not working, you might need to clean up some things.
Try to one or more of the following:

  - Check if there are left over processes and kill them.
    Most likely there is still a *tsclient* process.
  - Remove leftover shared memories if present:
    `sudo rm /dev/shm/flesnet_*`
  - Re-program the FLIB FPGA.


### How can I check if the FLIB is installed correctly?

See the *Check* Section in *Preparing the FLIB*.


### What to do if the FLIB/PC gets unresponsive after programming or a few
  minutes of use?

  - Set the Linux boot parameters: 'pcie_aspm=off 'acpi=ht noapic'.
  - Try to disable ASPM in the BIOS settings of your host PC.

### My syslog/kernel log is flooded with errors like:

    flip00 kernel: [  573.734102] pcieport 0000:00:01.0: AER: Corrected error received: id=0008
    flip00 kernel: [  573.734113] pcieport 0000:00:01.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Physical Layer, id=0008(Receiver ID)
    flip00 kernel: [  573.734115] pcieport 0000:00:01.0:   device [8086:0e02] error status/mask=00000001/00002000
    flip00 kernel: [  573.734117] pcieport 0000:00:01.0:    [ 0] Receiver Error         (First)

  - Set the Linux boot parameters: 'pcie_aspm=off 'acpi=ht noapic'


### Flesnet can not allocate enough memory.

  - The softiwarp install script installs a configuration to /etc/security/limits.d/.
    You need to re-login after installing for these changes to take affect.
  - If the problem is still present, try `sudo ulimit -l unlimited` as a workaround.


### Programming the FLIB FPGA is very slow (takes longer than 60s).

- There is an issue with the Xilinx Lab Tools.
  Try this [solution from the Xilinx forums][impact-fix].

[impact-fix]: http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Design-Tools-Others/iMPACT-severe-TCK-frequency-derating-under-Linux-still-the-same/m-p/422263#M5692

### The FLIB programming script reports the warning:

    Warning: Chain frequency (1000000) is less than the current cable speed (6000000).
     Adjust to cable speed (1000000).
    Maximum TCK operating frequency for this device chain: 1000000.

  - See 'Programming the FLIB FPGA is very slow'.


### The PC restarts immediately after I try to shut it down.

This is a hardware issue with HTG-K7 rev 1.0 boards. It is caused by the PCIe
wake signal changing its state when the FPGA looses configuration after power
down.

Known workarounds:

  - Unplug the power after shutting down.
  - Try to disable PCIe wake capability, e.g. by changing wake-on-lan BIOS
    settings.
  - Isolate the wake# pin on the PCIe connector.
