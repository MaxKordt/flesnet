FLESnet usage for FLIB stand alone readout
==========================================

General:
--------

SIMPATH has to point to a fairroot external packages installation

FLESnet:
--------

cd build
./flesnet --help
cp ../contrib/flesnet_flib_example.cfg ./flesnet.cfg
modify flesnet.cfg:
 - add as many lines 'input-nodes = localhost' as readout links
 - choose 'processor-executable' ,e.g. to store data

Example: read 4 FLIB input links.
Start flib_ctrl before starting flesnet!
./flesnet -i0 -i1 -i2 -i3 -c0
 - add as many -iN as readout links


FLIB Control:
-------------

cd build
./flib_ctrl --help

Example: read flib input links with microslice size 8 Âµs.
Do not start/stop while flesnet is running!
./flib_ctrl -t 1000 -s link


Control Client:
---------------

cd ctrl
source config.sh
cd control/cliclient
./cliclient -help

Example: send DLM 0x8 over flib link 0 to nodeid 0x1.
./cliclient localhost:9750 dlm 0x1 0x8


Preparing the FLIB
==================

Download a bitfile from the build server
----------------------------------------

run, e.g.:

curl -O -u <GSI web login user> https://cbm-firmware.gsi.de/result/XX/flib_cnet_readout/XXX/htg_k7_cnet_readout.bit


Programming the FPGA
--------------------

cp contrib/flib-reprogramm to a location in your path and adopt settings
usage:
flib-reprogramm path/to/bitfile.bit

If programming the FPGA the first time since powerup or 
your machine does not support PCIe hot-plugging you need to reboot 
the machine after programming.


Loading/reloading the kernel driver
-----------------------------------

After rebooting you machine you need to load the kernel driver

cd misc/kernel
sudo ./reload.sh


Check
-----

lspci -v should give you something like

...
